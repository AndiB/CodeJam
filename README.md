# CodeJam2016
Contains my solutions to some of the 2016 Google code jam tasks (posted after the contest closes of course) and solutions to select questions from previous code jams which I did to practice for 2016. 

I cleaned up the code a little bit but the main functionality is the same. 

Sometimes, there are two different source code files for the solutions to the small and large input set. This is due to necessary rewrites (and changing algorithms). The solution for the small input set most likely contains a simple brute force method. 

I anticipate bowing out of the contest on April 30th, as that is a date when I like many others, are moving from one location to another.
